{% blocktrans %}The <a href="{{ create_url }}" target="_blank">Create</a> page is where the user can select an area of interest, describe the export, select file formats and feature tags, load a preset file and specify to either keep the export private or share it publicly.

<h3>{% trans 'Export Wizard' %}</h3>
<div class="well">
{% blocktrans %}The 'Create' page is set up like a wizard so that the user is guided through the required steps to create an export. The user can not move on to the next section until they have completed the neccessary parts of the current section.
<p>Similarly, certain functionality will be locked if another method has been chosen, such as the 'Tree Tag' and 'Preset File'. These can not be both applied to the same export, and the use of one method will deactivate the other.</p>
There are five tabs that make up the 'Export Wizard' on the 'Create' page. These include the 'Describe Export', 'File Formats', 'Tree Tag', 'Preset File' and 'Export Summary', which are detailed below: {% endblocktrans %}
<ol>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Describe Export:' %}</strong> {% trans "Enter the name, description and project (optional) of the new export. Select the area of interest on the map (right section)." %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'File Formats:' %}</strong> {% trans "Select one or more file format(s) for the export." %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Tree Tag:' %}</strong> {% blocktrans %}Expand and select features from the HDM or OSM tree tag for export and click 'Next'. Preset files on the next tab can not be used if tags are selected from either tree. Please see the <a href="{{ help_features_url }}" target='_blank'>Feature Selection</a> help page for further information.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Preset File:' %}</strong> {% trans "Select a preset file to apply to the export area by either specifying a name and loading a file from the desktop, or select a preset file from the saved presets. Tick the 'Publish this preset publicly' button to share the loaded preset publicly and save it to the 'Presets' page." %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Export Summary:' %}</strong> {% trans "This tab provides an overview of the export settings, along with the options to 'Save feature selection privately', 'Publish feature selection publicly' and 'Publish export publicly'. Click 'Create Export' to complete and run the new export." %}</li>
</ol>
</div>
<a href="#top">{% trans 'top' %}</a>

<h3>{% trans 'Export Details' %}</h3>
<div class="well">
{% blocktrans %} The user will be redirected to the 'Export Details' page once they have clicked 'Create Export' and the export successfully runs. This page contains the details and status of the export, including the history of runs.

<p>The OSM features applied to the export can be viewed by clicking the 'Export Features' button at the bottom of the page. If the features were selected using the 'Tree Tag', this will be replicated in a pop-up window. If a 'Preset File' was used then the features selected will be listed in the XML file.</p>

<p>There are several options available on this page to apply to the Export, which include the ability to 'Rerun Export', 'Clone Export', or 'Delete Export'. The functionality of these options are detailed below: {% endblocktrans %}

<ol>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Re-run Export:' %}</strong> {% trans "This function will rerun the export with the original area of interest and settings for feature tags and file formats." %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Clone Export:' %}</strong> {% trans "This function will clone the export, maintaining the original area of interest but allows the user to modify the settings for feature tags and file formats." %}</li>
    <li><strong>{% trans 'Delete Export:' %}</strong> {% trans "Delete the saved export. Please note that this function is only available to the user who originally created the export." %}</li>
